# Spotify-api 
The api is made using python and it helps the user create a playlist through it.

Access Token !!!
In order for your code to run you need a new access token from spotify which expires in 1hr
it can be generated from https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api 

After getting the access token you place it here in the code

import requests


SPOTIFY_CREATE_PLAYLIST_URL = 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/wafs/pLaylists' // edit the user id to your own spotify user id which can be found at https://www.spotify.com
ACCESS_TOKEN =  'here'
